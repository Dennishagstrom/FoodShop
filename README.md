THIS IS MY SOLUTION TO THE TASK I MADE


# FoodShop #

TASK:

##############################

FoodShop is a new shop located in Oslo. The owner of the shop recently bought a smart fridge, but sadly it did not come with a system included. Your job will be to add a system to this fridge.

Create a fridge storage where the employees will be able to add and remove items from the fridge. The fridge should keep track of which employee has taken out, or put in items to the fridge and what the amount was.

The fridge should display, at all times, how many of each product is inside the fridge, what the total price of all products inside the fridge are, and show some kind of notification if the amount of an item is lower than 3. This is to let the employees know they need to order more products.


The following is a list of products FoodShop have:

Tomato: 0.30$ 
Potato: 0.80$ 
Onion: 0.40$ 
Carrot: 0.50$ 
Celery: 1.00$ 
Lettuce: 1.20$ 
Spinach: 1.10$ 
Cabbage: 1.60$ 
Beetroot: 0.70$ 
Turnip: 0.60$ 
Parsnip: 0.90$ 
Mushroom: 1.40$
